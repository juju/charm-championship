## This is the Juju config file, which you can use to specify multiple environments in which to deploy.
## By default Juju ships AWS (default), HP Cloud, OpenStack.
## See https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs for more information

## An environment configuration must always specify at least the following information:
##
## - name (to identify the environment)
## - type (to specify the provider)
## - admin-secret (an arbitrary "password" identifying an client with administrative-level access to system state)

## Values in <brackets> below need to be filled in by the user.

## The default environment is chosen when one is not specified using either:
##   -e, --environment command line parameter
##   JUJU_ENV environment variable
## If both -e and JUJU_ENV are specified, the command line parameter has precedence.
default: amazon
